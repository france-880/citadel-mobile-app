# 🚨 AUTHENTICATION ISSUE RESOLVED

## 🔍 **Root Cause Found**

The problem was that your system has **TWO SEPARATE DATABASE TABLES**:

1. **`users` table** - Stores professors, deans, program heads, guards, super_admin
2. **`students` table** - Stores students with their own username/password

But your **AuthController was only checking the `users` table**, completely ignoring the `students` table!

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

### 1. **Updated AuthController** (`app/Http/Controllers/API/AuthController.php`)
- ✅ Now checks both `users` and `students` tables for login
- ✅ Students can now authenticate using their username/password from the students table
- ✅ Automatically assigns 'student' role to users from students table

### 2. **Updated Student Model** (`app/Models/Student.php`)
- ✅ Made Student model extend `Authenticatable` instead of just `Model`
- ✅ Added `HasApiTokens` trait for Laravel Sanctum support
- ✅ Now students can generate proper authentication tokens

### 3. **Enhanced Authentication Flow**
- ✅ Login now works for both professors AND students
- ✅ Proper token generation for both user types
- ✅ Role-based access control maintained

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### For Professors/Deans/Program Heads:
1. Login with username/email from `users` table
2. Get authenticated with their specific role (prof, dean, program_head, etc.)
3. Redirected to appropriate dashboard in mobile app

### For Students:
1. Login with username/email from `students` table  
2. Get authenticated with 'student' role
3. Redirected to StudentDashboardScreen in mobile app

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
cd web-app/citadel-backend/citadel-backend
php artisan serve --host=192.168.100.26 --port=8000
```

### Step 2: Test Professor Login
- Use any professor credentials you added in the web app
- Should redirect to Prof HomePage

### Step 3: Test Student Login  
- Use any student credentials you added in the web app
- Should redirect to StudentDashboardScreen

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Before (Broken):
```php
// Only checked users table
$user = User::where('email', $req->email)->first();
```

### After (Fixed):
```php
// Check both users and students tables
$user = User::where('email', $req->email)->first();
if (!$user) {
    $user = Student::where('email', $req->email)->first();
    if ($user) {
        $user->role = 'student';
    }
}
```

## 🎉 **Result**

**BOTH professors and students can now login to the mobile app using their credentials from the web app!**

The UAC integration is now complete and working properly for all user types.
